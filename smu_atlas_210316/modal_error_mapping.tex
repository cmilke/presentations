    \frametitle{Assessing Performance of Basis}
    \begin{itemize} {
        \item Some statistical findings of other members of the 4b group (Rachel Hyneman and James Grundy) have shown that large weights in the direct combination approach can lead to very low ``effective statistics"
        \item Checks on the statistics of the combinations have shown them to be very non-trivial
        \item Many different factors all play into the presence of large statistical errors
        \item Orthogonality may not actually be a good metric of statistical power
        \item Need a way to assess how effective any given basis set is at modelling distributions
    } \end{itemize}

\displaythree{Visualizing Error}
{ \small 
    $\kvv$, $\kl$, $m_{HH}$ bins, and relative error for each bin forms a 4D parameter space.
    This is unreasonable to visualize.

    \vspace{5mm}

    Need to trim down dimenionality by focussing on most relevant aspect of parameter space.
    My thinking: Look at the peak of the distribution.
