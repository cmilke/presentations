        \frametitle{Conclusions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item New signal samples have been produced, new combinations need to be determined
            \item Many oppurtunities for better optimization of linear combination approach
            \item Current work will involve identifying ideal (minimal error) basis sets
            \item Will likely develop a tool for use by other di-Higgs VBF groups
            \item Research into NLO effects and theoretical validity of approach will need to be investigated as well
            \item Future work may involve applying framework to HL-LHC simulations to attain projected limits with HGTD in place
        \end{itemize}
