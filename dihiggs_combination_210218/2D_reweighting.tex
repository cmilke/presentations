    \frametitle{Reweighting with Two Variables}
    Attempted 2D reweighting using all 21 combinations of the following 7 kinematic variables:
    \vspace{10mm}
    \begin{itemize} {
        {\large \item $M_{hh}$ }
        {\large \item $\Delta \eta_{hh}$ }
        {\large \item $p_{T,hh}$ }
        {\large \item $M_{jj}$ }
        {\large \item $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ }
        {\large \item $p_{T,jj}$ }
        {\large \item $p_{T}$ Sum, jj }
    } \end{itemize}
}

\importpdfwpages{all_var_combinations}{1}{21}

\frame{
    \frametitle{None of the 21 Combinations are Viable}
    Out of the 21 combinations of the 7 most obvious variables, none are even close to being usable for reweighting.

    \vspace{5mm}
    Note that this study is not exhaustive, and there are countless other variables and combinations of variables that could potentially show success.

    \vspace{5mm}
    However, finding the exact specific combination of variables could prove quite time-consuming, assuming such a combination even exists.
    As such, I am putting further research into VBF Reweighting on hold, and will focus efforts instead on direct linear combination of reconstructed, post-selection samples.

    \vspace{5mm}
    The direct combination approach has already proven useful for VBF, and focused effort could further improve it.
