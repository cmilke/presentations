\displayone{ MV2c10 Performance }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item Black curve is official calibration used in 2018 data taking
        \item Blue curve retuned using 4 Million ttbar monte carlo (production 410470)
        \item Blue and black tuned on different ttbar samples, so consistent performance is reassuring
        \item Primary objective is raise FTK performance closer to HLT levels
        \item FTKRefit-IDTrig shows little difference compared to FTK-IDTrig
    \end{itemize} }

\displaytwo{ IP2D and IP3D Performance }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item MV2c10 is a product of these two (among other variables)
        \item Both Taggers show performance issues for FTK
        \item As FTKRefit-IDTrig is not distinct from FTK-IDTrig,
            it will be omitted from further plots
        \item IP2/3D taggers are based on lower level track variables
