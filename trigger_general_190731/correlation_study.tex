    { \begin{itemize}
        \item Hold rejection level at 500
        \item Look only at B-Jets
        \item Compare FTK-IDTrig and HLT performance jet-by-jet
        \item Categorize each B-Jet by whether it was correctly tagged as a B-Jet (pass) by IP2D
        \item Studies on IP3D are under way

\displaythree{ d0 Correlation }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item HLT and FTK-IDTrig have higher failure rates at lower values of d0
        \item Class B is clearly distinguished in d0
        \item Suggests FTK-IDTrig performance falls off faster than HLT as d0 gets lower
        \item Class A and B overlap in error,
            suggesting error is not directly responsible for performance discrepency
        \item d0 Error may still be linked to d0 performance drop at low values. Study ongoing
