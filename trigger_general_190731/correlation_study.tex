    { \begin{itemize}
        \item Hold rejection level at 500
        \item Look only at B-Jets
        \item Compare FTK-IDTrig and HLT performance jet-by-jet
        \item Categorize each B-Jet by whether it was correctly tagged as a B-Jet (pass) by IP2D
        \item Studies on IP3D are under way

\displaythree{ d0 Correlation }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item HLT and FTK-IDTrig have higher failure rates at lower values of d0
        \item Class B is clearly distinguished in d0
        \item Suggests FTK-IDTrig performance falls off faster than HLT as d0 gets smaller
        \item Issues at low d0 may be explained by shift in error,
            but this is not visible from d0 error correlation plot.
            Further studies into this underway
