\displaytwo{ Comparing Track Parameters Jet by Jet }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose to fix rejection level at 500,
            in order to compare HLT and FTK-IDTrig fairly (as they are tuned seperately)
        \item Look only at B-Jets
        \item Compare FTK-IDTrig and HLT performance jet-by-jet
        \item Categorize each B-Jet by whether it was correctly tagged as a B-Jet (pass) by IP2D
        \item Studies on IP3D are under way
    \end{itemize} }

\displaythree{ d0 Jet by Jet Performance, FTK Distributions }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item $p_t > 55$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$
        \item HLT and FTK-IDTrig have higher failure rates at lower values of d0
        \item Class B is clearly distinguished in d0
        \item Suggests FTK-IDTrig performance falls off faster than HLT as d0 gets smaller
        \item Issues at low d0 may be explained by shift in error,
            but this is not visible from d0 error performance plot.
            Further studies into this underway
