\section{BDT Improvements}

\displayonelarge{From Last Time: My Initial Attempt at BDTs}{
    {\small My first attempts at a BDT were very rudimentary, using improper weighting, basic kinematic variables as inputs and poor statistics.}

    \vspace{10mm}

    {\tiny *BDT is trained using SKLearn, with inputs:}
    \begin{itemize}
        {\tiny \item $p_T$ of 2 leading-$p_T$ jets }
        {\tiny \item $\eta$ of 2 leading-$p_T$ jets }
        {\tiny \item $\phi$ of 2 leading-$p_T$ jets }
        {\tiny \item $Energy$ of 2 leading-$p_T$ jets }
        {\tiny \item $M_{jj}$ of leading $M_{jj}$ pair }
    \end{itemize}

\displayonelarge{Step 1: Actually Tell SK-Learn that Samples are Weighted}{
    As a baseline, train BDT with same inputs as current algorithm. It should perform at least as well.

    Improvent from first seven FW Moments is minor, but noticeable.

\displayonelarge{Step 3: Increase Statistics Using Cross Validation}{
    {\small Switching to TMVA and utilizing cross validation training improves performance with the same BDT inputs and architecture.
    Opens the door for more complex BDT architectures.}
