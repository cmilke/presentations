\section{VBF/ggF Separation Currently}

\displayonelarge{How does this Affect the Overall Analysis?}{
    With a more powerful VBF/ggF separation tool in hand, let's look at the effects on the rest of the analysis.

        The VBF BDT is able to at least match the current cut-based selection process for all studied values of \cvv.
        ggF contamination can be reduced rapidly with tighter values of the BDT cut.
