\displayonelarge{2D Limits without Signal Stat Error}{
    Original limits generated w/o stat error of signal.

    Comparing this with new limits that account for signal MC error (accidentally) provides a great measure of where this basis set is lacking

\displayonelarge{2D Limits with Signal Stat Error}{
    Inclusion of signal stat errors has almost no effect on 95\% CL limits at all.

    \vspace{5mm}
    Background uncertainties are likely so large as to completely dominate statistics.

\displayone{What about Systematic Uncertainty?}{
    Separate from statistical error, is the potential error in the mismodeling of the distribution itself.
