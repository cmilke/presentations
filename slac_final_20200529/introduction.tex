            I initially studied VBF/ggF Separation in single Higgs to invisible.

            Recently, I was asked to take a look at Di-Higgs to 4b.

    {\tiny \begin{itemize}
        \item VBF Pair: Remove events in which there are fewer than two jets that are {\bf not} btagged
        \item VBF dEta: Select the jet pair with the highest invariant mass as the  "VBF Pair".\\Remove events where the $\Delta \eta$ of this pair is less than 3
        \item VBF mjj: Remove events where the "VBF Pair's" invariant mass is less than 1000 GeV
