    In single Higgs case, centrality shows strong separation potential

\displayonelarge{Centrality in Di-Higgs}{
    In Di-Higgs, centrality {\it seems} much less effective...
    but HH has far more jets, and the > 3 jet situation cannot be ignored.
    How do we select which 3 to use?

\displayonelarge{Centrality in Di-Higgs, Many-Jet Situation}{
    Naively, take leading three $p_T$ jets... This has very poor results.

    VBF jets and their radiation have distinctive signatures beyond only leading $M_{jj}$

\displayonelarge{Centrality in Di-Higgs using Invariant-Mass Ranking}{
    Over 99\% of the time, one of the two jets of the Leading $M_{jj}$ pair is also
    in the Sub-leading $M_{jj}$ pair, resulting in three jets.

    Improvement from Centrality is very small,
    but there may be more to be gained with further study.
