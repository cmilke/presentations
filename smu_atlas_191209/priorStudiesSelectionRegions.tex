   % I'm having a hard time finding anything in papers that I can compare to my own methods.
   % They all use "acceptance", which is the algorithm efficiency x the % of events that pass the event selection criteria.

   %Maybe try to grab the presentation Katherine sent your way

    %WHY??: Look at the various analyses youâ€™ve found, and show the inefficiencies they work with that I hope to improve
        %VBF->H->gam-gam (relies on gam-gam tagging)
        %VBF->H->BBbar (relies on btagging)
        %VBF->H->Invis
