%    { \begin{itemize}
%        \item Black curve is official calibration used in 2018 data taking
%        \item Blue curve retuned using 4 Million ttbar Monte Carlo (channel ID 410470)
%        \item Blue and black tuned on different ttbar samples,
%            so consistent performance confirms the re-tuning works as expected
%        \item Primary objective is to see how close to 
%            HLT-only performance we can come with FTK tracks
%        \item In the present simulation, FTKRefit-IDTrig and FTK-IDTrig perform similarly

%    { \begin{itemize}
%        \item MV2c10 uses these two low-level taggers as inputs to the final tagging decision
%        \item Both Taggers show performance issues for FTK
%        \item As FTKRefit-IDTrig is not distinct from FTK-IDTrig,
%            it will be omitted from further plots
%        \item IP2/3D taggers are based on lower level track variables
