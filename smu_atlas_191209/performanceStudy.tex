\displayone{ MV2c10 Performance }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item Black curve is official calibration used in 2018 data taking
        \item Blue curve retuned using 4 Million ttbar Monte Carlo (channel ID 410470)
        \item Blue and black tuned on different ttbar samples,
            so consistent performance confirms the re-tuning works as expected
        \item Primary objective is to see how close to 
            HLT-only performance we can come with FTK tracks
        \item In the present simulation, FTKRefit-IDTrig and FTK-IDTrig perform similarly
    \end{itemize} }

\displaytwo{ IP2D and IP3D Performance }
    { \begin{itemize}
        \item MV2c10 uses these two low-level taggers as inputs to the final tagging decision
        \item Both Taggers show performance issues for FTK
        \item As FTKRefit-IDTrig is not distinct from FTK-IDTrig,
            it will be omitted from further plots
        \item IP2/3D taggers are based on lower level track variables 
    \end{itemize} }
