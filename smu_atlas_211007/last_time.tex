\section{New MC Signal Sample}
\displaythree{Last Time...}
{ \small
    2021 MC production (right) was very unstable in combination,
    manifesting as very poor signal modelling.
    \vspace{5 mm}

    Proposed solution was to generate one additional MC Signal Sample

    My proposed Extra Sample, [$\kvv=1, \kl=-5, \kv=0.5$],
    vastly improves combination stability

\displayone{Updated Exclusion Limits}{
    New exclusion limits are unfortunately worse along diagonal,
    but are almost certainly more accurate.
