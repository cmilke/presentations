\section{Negative Weight Metric}

\displaytwo{Negative Weights}{
    Negative weights can appear in the $m_{HH}$ combination. These are unphysical and should be avoided.

    In further regions of the $\kappa$ coupling space, these negative weights can be become dangerously common.

\displayonelarge{Assessing Basis Performance via Negative Weight Integral}{
    Take the surface integral of the number of negative bins at each point at in the $\kappa$ parameter space (mutliplying by the $\kvv \times \kl$ ``area") as a general metric of performance.

\displaytwocaption{Limits with Negative-Weight Integral Rank-1 Basis}{
    Fewer negative weights results in a much more ``natural" limit boundary.

    Sharp edges and corners appear to have been a consequence of poor signal modelling.
