                \item Basic Jet and track information
                \item Flavor probabilities and log-likelihood ratios for IP2D, IP3D, DL1r, and RNNIP
                \item The complete list of inputs to DL1r

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Pursued a number of different research paths
                \item Some paths were rendered irrelevant by other results
                \item Others were already being studied by other members
                \item I have a meeting scheduled with the 4b coordinators to establish a more promising research task
                \item None of my research paths led to useful results, but were at least informative for me

        \frametitle{Conclusion} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item B-Jet Trigger Online Monitoring is nearing completion
            \item HH Validation work is set and ready, but currenly held up from upstream issues
            \item Primary research has dead-ended, but new work will begin shortly, with more interesting results by next time
        \end{itemize}
