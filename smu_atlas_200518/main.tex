    % reiterate basic background and goal
    % show cutflow chart (VBF=1 vs ggF) and explain what's happening. point out where I care
    % note the huge number of ggF events getting through. My goal is to reduce this
    % Show the varied c2v value chart, if only because I made it. Through the kinematics in backup
    % Roc curve time! Use mjj distro and cumalitive distro to explain how I made roc curves
    % Now show the unweighted roc curves to show the different performances
    % Show my BDT
    % Now dissapoint everyone with the weighted version... hey steve, how do I weight stuff in SKlearn BDTs?

    % uhhh... I'm doing work for them? it's all pretty technical so I'm not really sure what to do here
    % Oh, I should probably mention how my DOE contract is ending so I'm wrapping things up and will soon be back in Dallas

        \begin{itemize} {
            \item The migration of B-Jet Trigger Monitoring Variables is moving along well
            \item My first merge request has been submitted
            \item New variables are already programmed in
            \item I've joined the 4b di-Higgs group to assist with VBF jet selection
            \item Will likely base my thesis on the \cvv measurement and my contributions towards it
        } \end{itemize}
