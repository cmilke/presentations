        \begin{itemize} {
            {\large \item Linear combinations are able to effectively reweight distributions at truth level}
            {\large \item There are still significant problems with using truth distributions to reweight reconstructed events though}
            {\large \item Investigation still ongoing, with further details expected by the next meeting}
            {\large \item These issues are unfortunately delaying completion of the VBF reweighting tool}
        } \end{itemize}
