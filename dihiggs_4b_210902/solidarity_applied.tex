    Wide range of values to check, brute-force approach:
    \vspace{3mm}

    \begin{itemize} {
        \item $\kvv =$ numpy.arange(-1, 4.5, 0.5)
        \item $\kl =$ numpy.arange(-9, 11, 1)
        \item $\kv =$ [ 0.5, 1, 1.5 ]
        \item 660 different variations
        \item Require all combinations to include SM and $\kl=2$ point to reduce combinatorics
        \item Each variation then has $\approx$ 227 valid possible combinations
        \item Total of $\approx$ 148,820 different combinations
    } \end{itemize}
    \vspace{3mm}

    Add each new variation to available samples one at a time,
    recalculate the solidarity integral for all possible valid combinations with the new sample in place

\displaytwocaption{Solidarity Histograms}{
    Each variation tested produces $\approx$ 227 combinations,
    and each combination has its own solidarity integral.

\displaytwo{Performance Predictions}{
    Sum together the solidarity integrals of all possible combinations to produce a heatmap of potential improvement.
    \vspace{3mm}

    Improvement largely seems to come from placing a sample in the middle of the poor-performing regions
