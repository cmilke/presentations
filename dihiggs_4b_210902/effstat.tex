    Effective Statistics also acts as a similar measure of ``closeness''.

    \textit{Effective Stats},
    $\epsilon \equiv \frac{ (\sum\limits_{i=1}^6 c_i\sigma_i)^2 }{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^6 (c_i\sigma_i)^2 } $

    Unlike solidarity, effective stats \textit{heavily}
    penalizes negative coefficients and large cancellations between samples.

\displaytwocaption{Effective Statistics VS Solidarity}{
    Effective Stats favors the upper-right region over all else.
    However, truth simulations of samples in this region produce mediocre performance gains,
        in line with the predictions of solidarity.
