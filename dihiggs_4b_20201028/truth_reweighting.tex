\displayone{Attempting Truth Reweighting}
{
    Use the six truth basis samples to reweight standard model NNT,
    via reweight function:

    \vspace{5mm}

    { \tiny
    $ w(\kvv=x,\kl=y,\kv=z, \textrm{bin}\,i) $

    \vspace{3mm}

    $ = \frac{ m_{HH}^{\kvv=1,\kl=1,\kv=1,i}}{m_{HH}^{\kvv=x,\kl=y,\kv=z,i} }$
    }

    \vspace{5mm}

    The results are quite terrible...

\displaythree{Truth Reweighting Has Obstacles}
{   
    Truth reweighting places such poor limits because 
    full reconstruction and selection heavily sculpt $m_{HH}$ distributions
