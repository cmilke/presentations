    { \scriptsize
        In VBF events, we expect that radiation (ISR or FSR) should be closely centered around the signature jets, compared to background events where the radiation is random.

{
    For example, choosing the jet pair with the largest $M_{jj}$ compresses the centrality distribution between -1 and 1.
