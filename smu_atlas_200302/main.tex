        \frametitle{Conclusions}
        \begin{itemize} {
            \item VBF events are a rich production mechanism for Higgs, which can be utilized more fully
            \item Three-jet VBF events are largely unexplored by current analyses, but can noticeably increase available statistics
            \item These events have a complex topology which presents many interesting handles for signal/background discrimination (e.g. Centrality, which has already been shown to improve performance)
            \item I have just started migrating the B-Jet Trigger Online Monitoring code to AthenaMT, and am getting a jump-start to this process at the AthenaMT workshop at CERN
        } \end{itemize}
