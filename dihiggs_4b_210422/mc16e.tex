\displaythree{Validation With Only MC16d}
{
    Until now, all my various validation plots were made using only MC16d samples, to simplify implementation.

\displaythreeseq{Effect of Other Years on Negative Weights}{
    What does adding different years do to the negative weights?
}{negative_weights_mc16d_old.png}{
    Adding in MC16a reduces negative weights, as expected of more stats
}{negative_weights_mc16ad_old.png}{
    The [0,1,0.5] sample is missing MC16e, and so trying to combine a, d, and e of the 6 samples ruins the linear combination.

\displaytwocaption{Original 1-D $\kvv$ Limits}
{
    Originally used MC16e in order to be able to compare official 3-term $\kvv$ scan to my 6-term combination.
    
    Other than a lack of fit points close to 1, the two match very well.
