    %\frame{\frametitle{Overview} \tableofcontents}

    % Show old limits, explain that many things have needed updating for awhile, and I'm doing that now
    \input{intro.tex}

    % Show Nweight integral with integral title
    % Show Top, mid, and current nweights
    % Show result of switching basis on limits
    \input{limit_update.tex}

    % Discound orthogonality and acceptance
    \input{discounted_causes.tex}

    % 1) show product of coefficients and sample, elaborate on why it's bad for these to be too different
    % 2) show formula for Solidarity, alongside a heatmap for some basis
    % 3) show correlation scatter plot between sol and nWeight
    % 4) show correlation scatter plot between theoretical sol and nWeight
    % 5) show brute force dump of projected "best samples"

    %Conclusion; Mention that systematics *still* don't work for some reasons...

        \frametitle{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize} {
            \item Choice of basis can have drasitic impacts on signal modelling and final limits
            \item New (nWeight) basis optimization metric reveals poor performance of old basis
            \item Unsure of how or even if to look further into orthogonality
            \item Acceptance X Efficiency,
                at least in the current 4b samples,
                seems to have no impact on overall performance of basis
            \item ``Solidarity" metric however appears to be very effective at determining basis performance
            \item New VBF samples have finished processing. Expect more extensive studies with new samples soon.
        } \end{itemize}
